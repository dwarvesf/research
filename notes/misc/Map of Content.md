The concept of Map of Content (MoC) was first introduced by [Nick Milo](https://twitter.com/NickMilo), who also happens to manage courses on [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/learn-more)

## What is it?

It is essentially a note containing links to other notes and helps locate content across the whole knowledge base. This is independent of where the notes are stored and how they are initially labelled. We use it to aggregate, connect, and manage ideas and notes in a scalable way.

## How we expect to manage it

There should be a Map of Content for every folder topic in our brainery. In the event there are a ton of MoCs, we also intend to have an MoC for our MoCs to help readers and contributors navigate through our second brain.
